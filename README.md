# IoT-Based Obstacle Avoidance Robot

An Arduino-based autonomous robot capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and servo motors. This project was developed as part of the **CC5068NI - Cloud Computing and Internet of Things** module during Spring Semester 2025 at Islington College.

# Features
- Real-time obstacle detection using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- Autonomous path adjustment with servo-based scanning
- Controlled by Arduino Uno with L293D Motor Driver Shield
- Low-cost, educational prototype for learning embedded systems and IoT

# Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- L293D Motor Driver Shield
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motor
- 4 Ã— Gear Motors with Wheels
- Lithium-Ion Battery & Holder
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard/Chassis

# How It Works
The ultrasonic sensor scans the surroundings using a servo motor. If an obstacle is detected within a threshold distance, the Arduino processes the data and commands the motors to change direction accordingly. The robot operates fully autonomously without user input.
